## Your task is to build a two-page React.JS application.
1. Build a product page where all products should be listed.
2. Build a product detail page - On click of any product on the last page, it should take to the
product detail page.


## Product data displayed should be using the REST API provided below.
1. Products Page: http://test.indiaindex.com/products.json
2. Product Detail Page: http://test.indiaindex.com/products/{id}.json (put product id in the above
API for example for the product with id 1 the API endpoint is
http://test.indiaindex.com/products/1.json )
